features:
  - |
    OVN-BGP-Agent has been added.
  - |
    Support for networking-bgpvpn in Neutron has been added.
  - |
    FRR has been added.
    While the primary goal was to provide the dependency for ovn-bgp-agent,
    it can also be used on its own, for example to establish connectivity
    between nodes in a pure L3 datacenter.
    As there are countless possibilities to configure FRR and this highly
    depends on the individual design choices, there is no default here and
    the user is expected to provide the configuration file.
    ovn-bgp-agent provides some examples in its
    `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ovn-bgp-agent/latest/>`__.

    The horizon deployment has been modified to allow the configuration of the
    BGPVPN extension.
